Participant Policies

> Please Sign In-
If it's your first time here, also
fill out a participation form.

• Hands Off Approach- RIBs values learning,
education, and empowerment. We don't fix things
for you, rather we help you do it yourself.

• Ask for Help- If you don't know how to use a
tool or part please ask.

• Open Shop & Used Parts are available to
everyone for free, but your donations
are very important. RIBs relies on the practice
of mutual aid. This means that we are able to be
here when you need us because of your donations
and volunteer time.

• Bicycles for Sale have been inspected and
repaired by RIBs staff. They are guaranteed against
defects for 30 days.

• Build a Bike Program- Bikes not for sale or
otherwise allocated can be repaired, rebuilt, or just
plain built from parts freely available on site. Once
the bike meets our safety standards, you may thenown the bicycle if you wish (and even ride it home
^_^ ).

• RIBs is Elite But Not Elitist- We hold
that a bicycle should be judged by its safety, its
functionality, its beauty, its historical value, and its
utility. RIBs upholds the bicycle as an object of art
and purpose regardless of the price tag, the
pedigree, the popularity, or current fashion trends.

• RIBs is a Safer Space- This means that we
don't tolerate language or behavior that is sexist,
racist, homophobic, trans phobic, condescending,
abusive, or violent. Ask before touching anyone
else's project, certainly ask before touching anyone
themselves, and try your best to listen as much as
you speak.
